JQlite:
$(selector).method()
AngularJS's jqLite
jqLite provides only the following jQuery methods:

addClass() - Does not support a function as first argument
after()
append()
attr() - Does not support functions as parameters
bind() (deprecated, use on()) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData
children() - Does not support selectors
clone()
contents()
css() - Only retrieves inline-styles, does not call getComputedStyle(). As a setter, does not convert numbers to strings or append 'px', and also does not have automatic property prefixing.
data()
detach()
empty()
eq()
find() - Limited to lookups by tag name
hasClass()
html()
next() - Does not support selectors
on() - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData
off() - Does not support namespaces, selectors or event object as parameter
one() - Does not support namespaces or selectors
parent() - Does not support selectors
prepend()
prop()
ready() (deprecated, use angular.element(callback) instead of angular.element(document).ready(callback))
remove()
removeAttr() - Does not support multiple attributes
removeClass() - Does not support a function as first argument
removeData()
replaceWith()
text()
toggleClass() - Does not support a function as first argument
triggerHandler() - Passes a dummy event object to handlers
unbind() (deprecated, use off()) - Does not support namespaces or event object as parameter
val()
wrap()
jQuery/jqLite Extras
AngularJS also provides the following additional methods and events to both jQuery and jqLite:

Events
$destroy - AngularJS intercepts all jqLite/jQuery's DOM destruction apis and fires this event on all DOM nodes being removed. This can be used to clean up any 3rd party bindings to the DOM element before it is removed.
Methods
controller(name) - retrieves the controller of the current element or its parent. By default retrieves controller associated with the ngController directive. If name is provided as camelCase directive name, then the controller for this directive will be retrieved (e.g. 'ngModel').
injector() - retrieves the injector of the current element or its parent.
scope() - retrieves the scope of the current element or its parent. Requires Debug Data to be enabled.
isolateScope() - retrieves an isolate scope if one is attached directly to the current element. This getter should be used only on elements that contain a directive which starts a new isolate scope. Calling scope() on this element always returns the original non-isolate scope. Requires Debug Data to be enabled.
inheritedData() - same as data(), but walks up the DOM until a value is found or the top parent element is reached.
